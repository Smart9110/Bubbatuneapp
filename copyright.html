Drafting notes for free copyright notice
Copyright is the primary intellectual property right protecting websites. This is a free copyright notice template, designed for inclusion on a website. It includes an assertion of copyright ownership, 
as well as provisions concerning the licensing of website copyright, the infringement of website copyright materials, and copyright notifications.
Copyright is one of the major intellectual property rights. Copyright protects certain classes of work, including literary works (e.g. written text and software), artistic works (e.g. drawings, photographs and graphics) 
and musical works. Although websites are not protected as websites, some of the constituent elements of a website will almost always attract copyright protection.
This document may be incorporated into more general terms and conditions, or may be used as a stand-alone notice.
A copyright notice is sometimes called a "copyright statement".

Section 2 - Copyright notice
Section 2.1
What was the year of first publication of the relevant copyright material (or the range of years)? Who is the principal owner of copyright in the website?

Section 3.3

Section 5 - Report abuse
Websites that allow the publication of user generated content should incorporate an abuse reporting procedure. The existence of such a procedure may help the website 
operator to take advantage of certain defences that may be available in respect of such user generated content. 
For instance, the website operator defence set out in Section 5 of the Defamation Act 2013 and elaborated in the Defamation (Operators of Websites) Regulations 2013 will only be available 
where the operator has responded to a notice of complaint sent by the complainant, a process which may be made simpler by the use of a dedicated communications channel. The guidance notes accompanying the 
legislation have this to say on the subject: "The Government encourages operators to set up and publicise a designated email address for this purpose as a matter of good practice, which we encourage</p>
