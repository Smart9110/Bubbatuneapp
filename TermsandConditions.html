<h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>

<h4>Last updated: June 30, 2017</h4>

<p>Please read these Terms and Conditions ("Terms", "Terms and Conditions") carefully before using the https://www.Uhinkle.com website (the "Service") operated by Uhinkle ("us", "we", or "our").

Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned upon your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who wish to access or use the Service.

By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms then
you do not have permission to access the Service.</p>

<h2>Purchases</h2>

<p>If you wish to purchase any product or service made available through the Service ("Purchase"), you may be asked to supply certain information relevant to your Purchase including, without limitation, your credit card number, the expiration date of your credit card, your billing address, and your shipping information.

You represent and warrant that: (i) you have the legal right to use any credit card(s) or other payment method(s) in connection with any Purchase; and that (ii) the information you supply to us is true, correct and complete.

The service may employ the use of third party services for the purpose of facilitating payment and the completion of Purchases. By submitting your information, you grant us the right to provide the information to these third parties subject to our Privacy Policy.

We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order at any time for reasons including but not limited to: product or service availability, errors in the description or price of the product or service, error in your order or other reasons.

We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order if fraud or an unauthorized or
illegal transaction is suspected.</p>

<h3>Availability, Errors and Inaccuracies</h2>

<p>We are constantly updating product and service offerings on the Service. We may experience delays in updating information on the Service and in our advertising on other web sites. The information found on the Service may contain errors or inaccuracies and may not be complete or current. Products or services may be mispriced, described inaccurately, or unavailable on the Service and we cannot guarantee the accuracy or completeness of any information found on the Service.

We therefore reserve the right to change or update information and to correct errors, inaccuracies, or omissions at any
time without prior notice.</p>

<h2>Contests, Sweepstakes and Promotions</h2>

<p>Any contests, sweepstakes or other promotions (collectively, "Promotions") made available through the Service may be governed by rules that are separate from these Terms & Conditions. If you participate in any Promotions,
please review the applicable rules as well as our Privacy Policy. If the rules for a Promotion conflict with these Terms and Conditions,
the Promotion rules will apply.</p>

<h2>Subscriptions</h2>

<p>Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle").
Billing cycles are set on a annual basis.</p>



<p>At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or Uhinkle cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account management
page or by contacting Uhinkle customer support team.</p>

<p>A valid payment method, including credit card or PayPal, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You shall provide Uhinkle with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number,
and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize Uhinkle to charge all Subscription fees incurred
through your account to any such payment instruments.<p>

<p>Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Uhinkle will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding
to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.</p>

<h2>Fee Changes</h2>

<p>For Bubbatunes a Subsidary of Uhinkle Corporation subscription price will be $5.49 a month</p>

<p>Uhinkle, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.

Uhinkle will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.

Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement
to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.</p>

<h2>Refunds</h2>

<p>Certain refund requests for Subscriptions may be considered by Uhinkle on a case-by-case basis and granted
in sole discretion of Uhinkle.</p>

<h2>Accounts</h2>

<p>When you create an account with us, you guarantee that you are above the age of 18, and that the information you provide us is accurate, complete, and current at all times. Inaccurate, incomplete, or obsolete information may result in the immediate termination of your account on the Service.

You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password, including but not limited to the restriction of access to your computer and/or account. You agree to accept responsibility
for any and all activities or actions that occur under your account and/or password,
whether your password is with our Service or a third-party service. You must notify us

or cancel orders in our sole discretion.</p>

and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have had between us regarding the Service.</p>
